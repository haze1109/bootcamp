      Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder
      <span style="font-size: 20px; color: black"
        >Serpentes /sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/.</span
      >[2] Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates
      covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with
      several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow
      prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their
      narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front
      of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional
      lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws
      on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without
      limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently
      via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.[3]
      These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have
      eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not
      universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae). Living snakes
      are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land
      masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland,
      Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as
      well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans.[4]
      Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific
      oceans. Around thirty families are currently recognized, comprising about
      520 genera and about 3,900 species.[5] They range in size from the tiny,
      10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake[6] to the reticulated python of
      6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length.[7] The fossil species Titanoboa
      cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.[8] Snakes are thought to have
      evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the
      Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and
      167 Ma ago.[9][10] The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the
      Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene
      extinction event). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be
      found in the Brooklyn Papyrus. Most species of snake are nonvenomous and
      those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than
      for self-defense. Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause
      painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey
      alive or kill by constriction.

          >Helianthus (/ˌhiːliˈænθəs/)</span
        >[2] is a genus comprising about 70 species of annual and perennial
        flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as
        sunflowers.[3][4] Except for three South American species, the species
        of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The
        best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), whose
        round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the Sun.[5]
        This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are
        cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops
        for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants.[6] The
        species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall,
        with the peak growth season being mid-summer.[7] Several perennial
        Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread
        rapidly and can become aggressive. On the other hand, the whorled
        sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species
        in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule
        protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats are
        industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and
        Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in
        woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.[8]
